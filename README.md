# Tutorial on Recursive Methods in C#

## Introduction

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. This tutorial explains recursive methods and provides thorough examples in C#.

### Understanding Recursion

A recursive method solves a problem by dividing it into smaller, more manageable subproblems. Each recursive call should bring the problem closer to a base case, which is the condition that stops further recursion.

### Example 1: Factorial Calculation

The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. It can be defined recursively.

**C# Code Example:**
```csharp
public int Factorial(int n)
{
    if (n <= 1) return 1; // Base case
    return n * Factorial(n - 1); // Recursive call
}
```

### Example 2: Fibonacci Series

The Fibonacci Series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The series starts with 0 and 1.

**C# Code Example:**
```csharp
public int Fibonacci(int n)
{
    if (n <= 1) return n; // Base cases
    return Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2); // Recursive call
}
```

### Example 3: Binary Search

Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It can be implemented recursively.

**C# Code Example:**
```csharp
public int BinarySearch(int[] arr, int l, int r, int x)
{
    if (r >= l)
    {
        int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == x) return mid; // Found the element

        if (arr[mid] > x)
            return BinarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1, x); // Search in left half

        return BinarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x); // Search in right half
    }
    return -1; // Element not found
}
```

### Understanding Recursive Calls

When using recursion, it's crucial to define a clear base case to prevent infinite loops. Each recursive call should work towards reaching this base case. Recursion can be more intuitive for problems that naturally fit into smaller subproblems, such as tree traversals, sorting algorithms, and mathematical sequences.

### Conclusion

Recursion is a powerful tool in a programmer's arsenal, providing elegant solutions to complex problems. Understanding and implementing recursion in C# can significantly enhance your problem-solving skills.
